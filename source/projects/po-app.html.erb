  <h1>Purchase Order Application</h1>
  <h2>Utilized by the Virginia House of Delegates Support Services Department used to manage vendors and purchases.</h2>
  <p>This application was an update of an older system created with Microsoft Sharepoint.  
  The new version is built with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, vanilla JS where possible and a bit of 
  jQuery sprinkled throughout.</p>

    <h3>Purchase Order Form</h3>
    <p>The design of the purchase order form was very important to the user.  It is an updated version 
  of a Sharepoint form that was created years ago.  The header of the form needed to remain very similar to 
  the original, but fonts were updated.  The main highlights would be the typeahead written by me in vanilla javascript to fuzzy search vendor names.  Adding an item to the 
  form also updates the DOM with a new row containing textareas and inputs where the running totals are 
  calculated.</p>

  <div class="explanation po-typeahead">
    <h3>Custom Built Typeahead</h3>
    <p>Because the PO app contains sensitive information and actual vendor data is stored in the database, 
    the Codepen to the right shows a demo of the same typeahead using almost the same code used in the app with 
    data from an anime api. As with the widget in the app, you can use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the list
    of results and press the Enter key to select one.  Alternatively you can use the mouse to scroll and select.</p>

    <h3>Adding and Deleting Items</h3>
    <p>When 'Add Item' is clicked, a new row is added to the actual 'Purchase Order' section of the form.  As numbers are added to the 'Qty' and 'Unit Cost' inputs, row totals,
     as well as a grand total are calculated using Javascript.  An item can easily be deleted using the red trash can 
     to the right.  Item is actually a nested Rails model which is being handled within the Purchase Order form with the help of Javascript.</p>
